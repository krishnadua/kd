Having taken the world of cricket aback with his 360 degree batting routine for India over the calendar year that included some of the worldlies at the T20 World Cup in Australia, ICC have appointed Suryakumar Yadav as the Men’s T20I Player of the Year for 2022.

The world cricket governing body took to their social media handles to announce the same.

Surya was the leading T20I run scorer in 2022, grabbing 1164 runs off 31 innings and was the only batter around the world to cross the 1000 run mark in the last calendar year.

His runs included nine half centuries and two hundreds, in England and New Zealand. The 32-year-old would add another to his tally in January 2023, becoming only the second Indian batsmen to score three T20I hundreds apart from skipper Rohit Sharma.

At the T20 World Cup in Australia, Surya was India’s second highest run scorer and third highest overall, notching 239 runs at a strike rate of 189.68. This included three half centuries.

Rohit Sharma is a right handed batsman who plays for the Indian cricket team and represents Mumbai in the domestic cricket. He has also held leadership role in being the skipper of the Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Rohit made his ODI debut at the age of 20 years in 2007 and later in the year he played his first T20I. Rohit had a slow rise to become a permanent fixture in the Indian setup but since 2013, he's maintained his foothold as the opening batsman in limited over contests. Rohit Sharma is most popular for his big scoring at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata where he scored 177 in a Test on debut. The love affair with the Eden Gardens grew when Rohit scored 264 against Sri Lanka which is the highest individual ODI score and in the process he became the first batsman to hit two double tons in ODIs.

Brisbane, Jan 16 (ANI): India’s ODI skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni has said that the Australian bowlers executed their plans well after his team lost second one-day by seven wickets in Brisbane. Rohit Sharma burnished his reputation in limited-overs cricket with a second successive century but could not stop Australia from winning the second one-day to consolidate their lead in the series. Dhoni admitted that the major problem in his side was of execution and the Australian bowling made it difficult for the Indian batsmen to score at the later stage of the innings. Australia's opening pair eventually fell in quick succession after identical knocks of 71, but George Bailey added 78 runs with skipper Steven Smith (46) and George Maxwell (26 not out) hit the winning run to complete the chase with one over to spare. Aaron Finch said his 145-run partnership with Marsh gave them an advantage and also praised counterparts’ bowling attack. Bailey followed his 112 in Perth with a 58-ball knock that included six boundaries and a six. The third ODI between the two teams will be played on Sunday in Melbourne.
