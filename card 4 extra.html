 <b style="font-size:30px;"> IND vs NZ 1st T20 Playing 11: Indian Express argues for the inclusion of Umran Malik and Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav in the first T20I.</b>

 India vs New Zealand, 1st T20I Predicted XI: India are set to take on New Zealand in a three-match series beginning on Friday at the Jharkhand State Cricket Association Stadium in Ranchi.  <br />

Hardik Pandya, who led the men in blue to a 2-1 series win over Sri Lanka earlier this month, is back leading the T20 side with some regulars and fringe players in the squad.

The likes of Shubman Gill, Suryakumar Yadav, Ishan Kishan and Kuldeep Yadav will get an extended run before they assemble for Test series camp at Nagpur from February 2

 Highest total recorded- 196/6 (20 Ov) by IND vs SL    <br /> <br />
Highest score chased- 155/3 (17.2 Ov) by IND vs NZ    <br /> <br />
Lowest score defended- 196/6 (20 Ov) by IND vs SL      <br /> <br />

Opening Combo

Mumbai opener Prithvi Shaw returns to the side but Pandya won’t be tempted to fiddle his set opening combination of Gill and wicketkeeper batter Ishan Kishan. Pandya was clear about who would open for his side. Shubman Gill, in sublime, has a clear headway over Shaw, who last featured for his country 17 months ago. “Shubman (Gill) has done well. He’ll start. It isn’t even about giving him an opportunity as he has been batting well and was already in the team before,” he asserted.

Will Spin Twins Reunite

In the last ODI, India had got a chance to witness ‘Kul-Cha’ in action after a long time but come the T20s, India may have to fret over the inclusion of either Kuldeep Yadav or Yuzvendra Chahal.

 India vs New Zealand, 1st T20I Pitch Report: The Ranchi surface has generally been helpful for spinners but with the dew factor coming into play, team winning the toss may bowl first.
